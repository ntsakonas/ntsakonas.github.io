# About me and this blog

I am a Java software engineer and in my free time , among others, I write software for leisure, recreation, self-education and fun!

My background in electronics has tought me that "if you cannot measure it, you will never understand it", and the same applies to engineering:
"If you do not code it, you will never understand it."

I use different languages depending on the platform, the mood and the goal. And yeah, I am exploring a wide range of platforms!
Ideas range from validating various thoughts and exploring new areas, to improving my skills, digging deeper into something or make something useful.

... or just have fun!

For that reason, there is absolutely no logic in how I pick the next thing to work on!

_"If you are sure that what you have to say is unique, then you are not out to please or not to please...or to impress or not to impress...you have your message and that's it...if they like it it's allright, if they don't...."_ - Claudio Arrau
